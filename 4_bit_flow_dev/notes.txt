get gate of output 2 -
Gate * out2 = gate(slit(2));
gates[i] has all the gates

get the gate constraint (polynomial)
Polynomial * p1 = n1->get_gate_constraint();

variable - assigned to a gate (gate output)
{
	hash_Value - for variables - used for storing terms
	level - order of the variables
	num - value to relate AIG gates to gate class
}

vstack used to build term

term = variable + rest 
{
	variable
	tail in linkedlist 
	ref counter
	hash
	next - hash collission link	
}

monomial = coefficient + term
{
	term
	coeff
	ref counter
}

polynomial = monomials in a stack (sorted mstack)
{
	sorted deque of monomials
