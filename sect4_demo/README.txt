This folder contains two demonstrations which show how 
parts of AMulet may be integrated in a bigger workspace.

demo_polylib:
  Demonstrates how to use the polynomial library.


demo_polysolver:
  Demonstrates how the polynomial solver can be used to solve
  multipliers given as gate netlists.


The demos may be run by :
		./run.sh
		
(You need to run './build_all.sh' in the main directory of the artifact first.)
